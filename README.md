# 705_IMDB_Dashboard

My project is about the information and data visualization of the top 222 movies on IMDB website. Data sources come from https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?groups=top_250&sort=num_votes,desc and I gathered data by using "web scraping" skills and packages such as requests and BeautifulSoup.
